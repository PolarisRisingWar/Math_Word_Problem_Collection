The total amount of alcohol in the 75% solution is 0.75 * (1 - x) and the total amount of alcohol in the 50% solution is 0.50 * y.\n\nStep 7: The total amount of alcohol in the final solution should be 0.65 * 1 (since we want a 65% solution).\n\nStep 8: We can set up the equation:\n\n0.75 * (1 - x) + 0.50 * y = 0.65\n\nNow, we have a system of two equations:\n\n(1 - x) + y = 1\n\n0.75 * (1 - x) + 0.50 * y = 0.65\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of x and y. After calculating, we get x ≈ 0.44 and y ≈ 0.56.\n\nSo, approximately 0.44 gallons of the 75% alcohol solution must be drained off and replaced by 0.56 gallons of the 50% alcohol solution to produce one gallon of the 65% alcohol solution.", "predict_result": 0.44}
{"model_prediction": "Step 1: Start by setting up an equation to represent the amount of money each person has saved over time.\n\nFor yourself, the amount of money saved over time can be represented as 7w + 160, where w is the number of weeks.\n\nFor your friend, the amount of money saved over time can be represented as 5w + 210, where w is the number of weeks.\n\nStep 2: Set the two equations equal to each other to find the number of weeks it will take for both of you to have saved the same amount of money.\n\n7w + 160 = 5w + 210\n\nStep 3: Solve for w to find the number of weeks it will take for both of you to have saved the same amount of money.\n\nSubtract 5w from both sides:\n\n7w - 5w + 160 = 210\n\n2w + 160 = 210\n\nSubtract 160 from both sides:\n\n2w = 50\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nw = 25\n\nAfter 25 weeks, both you and your friend will have saved the same amount of money.", "predict_result": 25.0}
