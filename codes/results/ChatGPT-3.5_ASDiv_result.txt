{"model_prediction": "Let's denote the age of Anna as A, the age of Ben as B, the age of Cathy as C, and the age of Denver as D.\n\nGiven that the ages of Anna and Ben differ by 3 years, we can write the equation:\nB = A + 3\n\nGiven that Anna's father Denver is twice as old as Anna, we can write the equation:\nD = 2A\n\nGiven that Ben is twice as old as his sister Cathy, we can write the equation:\nB = 2C\n\nGiven that the ages of Cathy and Denver differ by 30 years, we can write the equation:\nD - C = 30\n\nFrom the first equation, B = A + 3, we can substitute this into the third equation:\nA + 3 = 2C\n\nSolving for C, we get:\nC = (A + 3)/2\n\nSubstitute this into the fourth equation, D - (A + 3)/2 = 30:\n2D - A - 3 = 60\n2D = A + 63\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation, D = 2A:\n2(2D - 63) = A\n4D - 126 = A\n\nNow, we substitute A = 4D - 126 into the first equation, B = A + 3:\nB = 4D - 126 + 3\nB = 4D - 123\n\nNow, substitute D = 2(2D - 63) into the equation above to solve for D:\n4D - 123 = 4(2D - 63) - 126\n4D - 123 = 8D - 252 - 126\n4D - 123 = 8D - 378\n255 = 4D\nD = 63.75\n\nNow we can find the age of Anna:\nA = 2D = 2(63.75) = 127.5\n\nAnd the age of Ben:\nB = A + 3 = 127.5 + 3 = 130.5\n\nSo, Anna is 127.5 years old and Ben is 130.5 years old.", "predict_value": 130.5}
