You have 160 dollars and save 7 dollars per week. Let's calculate how many weeks it will take for you to save the same amount as your friend.\n\nYour friend has 210 dollars and saves 5 dollars per week. We can set up the equation:\n\n160 + 7x = 210 + 5x\n\nTo solve for x, we can subtract 5x from both sides of the equation:\n\n160 + 7x - 5x = 210\n\n2x = 50\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\nx = 50 / 2\n\nx = 25\n\nTherefore, it will take you 25 weeks to save the same amount of money as your friend.\n\nNow let's think about your friend. Your friend has 210 dollars and saves 5 dollars per week. Let's calculate how many weeks it will take for your friend to save the same amount as you.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\n210 + 5x = 160 + 7x\n\nTo solve for x, we can subtract 7x from both sides of the equation:\n\n210 + 5x - 7x = 160\n\n-2x = -50\n\nTo solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by -2:\n\nx = -50 / -2\n\nx = 25\n\nTherefore, it will also take your friend 25 weeks to save the same amount of money as you.\n\nIn conclusion, it will take both of you 25 weeks to save the same amount of money.", "predict_result": 25.0}
