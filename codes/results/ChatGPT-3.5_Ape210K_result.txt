{"model_prediction": "To find out how many square tiles with side length of 25 cm are needed to cover a walkway that is 18 meters long and 5 meters wide, we must convert the dimensions of the walkway into centimeters.\n\n1 meter = 100 centimeters\n\nSo, the walkway is 1800 cm long (18 meters x 100 cm) and 500 cm wide (5 meters x 100 cm).\n\nThe area of the walkway is 1800 cm x 500 cm = 900,000 cm².\n\nTo find out how many tiles are needed, we need to divide the area of the walkway by the area of one tile.\n\nEach tile has an area of 25 cm x 25 cm = 625 cm².\n\n900,000 cm² (area of walkway) ÷ 625 cm² (area of one tile) = 1440\n\nTherefore, at least 1440 square tiles with a side length of 25 cm are needed to cover the walkway.", "predict_value": 1440.0}
