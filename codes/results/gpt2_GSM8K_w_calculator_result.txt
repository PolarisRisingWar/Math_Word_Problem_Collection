The driver has the first car and passed by the red exit point twice on his left side so he will have to stop at the yellow exit point twice by passing into the red.

If Mandy needs $11.50/month of interest, her interest is $4.50 for $9.50/month.\nSince Mandy needs $9 and the interest is $6/month, she owes $6/month?\nSince Mandy's interest is $5, Mandy needs $12/month, the interest will be $12,000.\nSo she borrows $100 for $5 for $8,000 in monthly interest, does she need $8/month?\nTherefore, $4=1*15=4*4*9+12% of Mandy's loan?\nShe borrows $4 of her interest for $12 in the interest, does she need $14/month?\nIf the interest is $12/month, Mandy needs $14,000 per month, does her interest increase?\nThere are $9,000/month and Mandy must borrow $10,000 to pay off Mandy's interest?\nThe answer is:\nMandy owes $4,000 per month and will pay back $100+12% of the loan.\nMandy needs $5+14,000 for $9,000, so Mandy does not need $9,000.\nSo she borrows $12,000 per month because she borrowed $4,000.\nIf she has $18,000/month, her interest is $7.50 and Mandy owes $10,000.\nSo she owes $18,000/month, she'll pay back $8", "predict_value": 8.0}

Joanne does not collect as much as her brothers, so if there are 10 apples for her brother, the average amount in the first year grows as much as she does from the height of her brother does from the height of the first year. Joanne's brother grows equally as much as her brother does for the same amount, so she grows as much as her brother does from the height of her brother does from the height of the first year. If Joanne collects 20,000 apples and her brother does 20,000, her brother collects 16 as much as her brother does for the same amount.\nIn the first year, Joanne collects 12 apples from the tallest tree in the region, because the height in the first year increases as much as her brother does from the height of the first year. If there are 15 apples, if her brother collects 60 or 80, the total increases as much as her brother does for that year, so the amount in the first year increases as much as her brother does from the total, so she collects 2. If there are 40 apples for her sister and 2 apples, she collects 80-90 in the first year, so her brother collects 20 apples from the average height for her sister.\nIf there were 40 apples at the height of Joanne's height, so her brother collects 80-90 for 20,000 as much, and her sister collects 30 apples, she has 20,000 in the first year, so he collects 15. If her brother takes 25 apples from the tall tallest tree, her brother has 35,000, so Joanne's total grows to 80-90, so her brother grows twice as much as Joanne did as she did for her sister.

If Juan's house cost more than $16,000, how much the value of his house is still worth now?\nThe answer is that Juan will make $5,000/month in the beginning of his new house, meaning he will buy $60,000 in 2018. If he paid $28,000/month, his house will still be worth $29,000/month.\nSo, Juan will get $29,000/month.

She will lose $16 because Gerald's loss of $28 in the ratio of 2:2 was $28-29.\nThere are three possible answers. If Julia has $30, Gerald spends $29 on a book, how much money did he have left? If she had $30 left, then Gerald would have lost $5 in the ratio of $29-30 and then his remaining $18 was $18. If Julia lost $18 in the ratio of $18, how much money did she have left?\nFor Julia's remaining funds, Julia won $32 as Gerald's percentage of $18 has fluctuated, and his remaining $18 was $18 as Julia lost $17:\nIf Julia lost $17-17 she will lose $17.\nIf Julia is also able to play \"Gerald and Julia\" by playing both, Gerald has the ratio of $17 and Julia loses $12 to $10, because Gerald's loss of $12 as Julia's total of $12+13+5 = $5, $13 = $18, $18-19!\nIf Julia loses $18 for 3 as he lost $12 = $22.\nThe answer? If Julia has $18, Gerald has $12/4 as Gerald's remaining income. If Julia has $19, Gerald has $18 for 2 as he loses $12 = $18+19; Gerald lost $10 for 3 as he lost $16.\nThus, Julia is $21! Gerald's return as Julia's total of $12+19 = $4!\nSo, Gerald had $22-29 as Julia's total of $42.\nIf Julia loses $42 as Gerald loses $11, he has $18+42= $5 = $22.\nIt's clear to say that Julia has $43 in his remaining money.\nIn terms of his remaining income, Gerald needs $22+9= $5!\nTherefore, he must have $52 as Julia earns $10 of Gerald's remaining money.

If there were 400 more, so there were 4 extra votes than 4. If there were four more, B received 3 fewer. If there were 400 more, B received 4 more. If B gave 4 more votes than 5, B received 5.\nLet's take the number of votes for the fourth candidate.\nSince B gave a total of 4 votes, there are 2 more than 5. The answer is:\nIf there were 400 votes for the third candidate, it means that there are 3 more than 5 total. If there are 4 more votes, there are 3 more votes than 5. If there are 4 more votes than 5, there are 3 more votes than 5 and 5 total. The answer is:\nIf there were no more, there are 3 more than 5.\nThe answer is:\nIf there were no more than 5 votes, there were 3 more than 5 votes than 5.

The answer is:\nFirst, find Jack's total number of dishes by multiplying each number by its number of towels. If Jack has twice as many towels than Jack in the store, divide the total number of dishes by 50, subtract 20 more, subtract 15 more and multiply the total number by a factor of 15.

Lisa won a $6-14 prize of cookies from Peter in her cookie jar: $16 in her jar. How much does Peter win? The answer is: $16.00. How much does Peter have to sell? The answer is: $24!\nIf Peter had to sell her 8 cookies, Lisa would have sold 13 more than Lisa did.\nLisa's prize is $0.0024. If the prize is $25, Peter would have bought Lisa $10 of cookies and her cookie jar at $25. Lisa's prize is $24.00!\nIn the end, Lisa wins $10, but Peter won $24! The answer is: $14.00! If Peter had sold 15 fewer cookies than Lisa did, her prize of $26.00 was $5!\nThis is the answer to the third answer:\nIf there were 12 more cookies, Peter is currently selling three and Lisa has sold half as much as she had in her jar, so Peter is currently selling 16 more cookies than Lisa, by buying 12 more cookies than Lisa did.\nThat means Lisa has won $26, so Peter is selling 16 fewer cookies than Lisa, and will win $7 more in cookies than Peter. Lisa is currently selling $15 and selling $14 for $18 each.\nLisa has a much larger prize, so there are 24 cookies and Peter has sold 36 more cookies than she did.

How much of Abraham's land will he be able to earn, at this point?\nThe answer is: $150-200 per square meter.\nAbraham's new land contains 20/20 trees, 20/20 houses. The tax should go toward the tax on every tree. If Abraham sold each tree 25 acres for $30 per square meter, he will earn $200-$300 per square meter. If he sold 2 acres for $20 per square meter he will earn $80, but he will get $30. If he sold the remaining land for $120 per acre he will earn $200-200.

The amount of tax collected from the sale and sale on every year's acre and all will be deducted, so the total tax will be $1,000/month on every tree. If we make $60/year the tax is equal to the amount of tax that Abraham paid, but the value will be $100 per acre, and the total tax will be $200-300 per year.\nSo the total tax will be $25-100 per acre. If Abraham sold 50/20 trees the total tax paid will be $70-300 per year and so the total tax paid is $240\nTherefore, if Abraham sold 50/20 of his forest for $600 per year, he will earn $150-200 per acre. If we assume he sold 10/20 trees a year for $600 per acre, he will earn $75.\nThen, the total amount will come to $225, while if he sold 60/20 trees the total tax would be $80-300 per acre, and that total amount will total $180-300 per acre\nTherefore, Abraham bought 40/20 of his forest for $160-200 per acre?

If Jake has $65 as $65 as $65, he will sell $65 + $65 / $65 = $60\nThis answer is:\nIf Jake spends $65 on all the shoes at the store, he will sell the same $65 every day if he owns $65 as he owns $65 + $60 = $75\nThat means, if Jake has $75 as $65 and $75 as $65, he will sell half the difference between $65 and $75 on the store. If Jake spends $25/75 as he buys all the shoes, he will buy $65 / $65 = $75 / $25+75= $25.\nIf Jake spends $25/25 as he goes to buy all the shoes and find $75 he will save $50+30/25 = $25 / $25\nLet's assume Jake has $100 - $30 = $20 = $50-50<|endoftext|>", "predict_value": -50.0}
