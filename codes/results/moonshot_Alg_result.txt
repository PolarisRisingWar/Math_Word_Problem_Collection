{"model_prediction": "Let's call the number you're looking for \"x\". According to the problem, 3 times this number minus 5 equals 40. We can write this as an equation:\n\n3x - 5 = 40\n\nNow, we want to solve for x. First, we'll add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x:\n\n3x - 5 + 5 = 40 + 5\n3x = 45\n\nNext, we'll divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\n3x / 3 = 45 / 3\nx = 15\n\nSo the number you're looking for is 15.", "predict_value": 15.0}
